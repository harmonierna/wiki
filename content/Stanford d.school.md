# Key facts

- **Founded:** 2004
- **Founder:** David Kelley (IDEO cofounder)
- **Named for:** Hasso Plattner, major benefactor
- **Location:** Stanford, California, USA
- **Focus:** Design thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, innovation education

# Mission and Approach

The d.school promotes “design thinking,” a methodology emphasizing empathy, prototyping, and iterative problem solving. It encourages teams to approach challenges from a human perspective, integrating insights from engineering, business, medicine, and the arts. The institute aims to cultivate creative confidence and innovation mindsets in students across disciplines.

# Programs and Offerings

While not granting its own degrees, the d.school offers courses, workshops, and fellowships open to students from any Stanford department. Signature programs include the Design Thinking Bootcamp, Executive Education, and K12 Lab for educators. Many of its project-based classes partner with external organizations, enabling participants to address social and environmental issues through design-led experimentation.

# Facilities and Community

Housed in a purpose-built facility designed to foster collaboration, the d.school features flexible spaces with writable surfaces, rapid prototyping tools, and informal meeting areas. The institute’s community includes students, faculty, and global innovators who share a commitment to creative problem solving and impact-driven design.

# Influence and Legacy

The d.school has been instrumental in spreading design thinking worldwide. Its teaching frameworks and methods have influenced organizations, governments, and educational institutions seeking to embed human-centred innovation. Alumni and affiliates have gone on to establish ventures and initiatives applying these principles at scale.

## Tech Giants With d.school/Stanford Roots

Some of the **most influential technology ventures in the world** trace back to Stanford ecosystems where design thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration are core values — even if they weren’t strictly d.school projects:

- **Google** – founded by Stanford CS students Sergey Brin and Larry Page.
- **Instagram** – started by Stanford students Kevin Systrom & Mike Krieger.
- **Snap (Snapchat)** – Evan Spiegel developed the idea while studying Product Design (taking d.school-style human-centred courses).

These companies illustrate how _design thinking mindset + technical expertise_ can scale into global platforms.
