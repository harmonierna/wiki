# Origins and evolution

IDEO emerged from the merger of several design firms led by David Kelley, Bill Moggridge, and Mike Nuttall, uniting strengths in product design and user experience. Early projects, such as developing the first commercially successful mouse for Apple, established its reputation for blending technology and human needs.

# Design thinking philosophy

IDEO popularized design thinking as a structured yet flexible process for innovation. The method emphasizes empathy with end users, iterative prototyping, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. It has been widely adopted across sectors including education, healthcare, and public policy, extending design practice beyond traditional product design.

# Notable projects and impact

IDEO has worked on diverse projects such as Apple’s early computing peripherals, the Palm V handheld device, and social-impact initiatives like redesigning school lunch programs and improving medical equipment usability. Its influence helped redefine design’s role from aesthetics toward strategic problem-solving and organizational transformation.

# Global presence and collaborations

The firm operates studios worldwide, including in San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and Munich. It collaborates with corporations, start-ups, non-profits, and governments, often through IDEO.org, its non-profit arm focused on tackling social challenges in areas such as health, education, and financial inclusion.

# Cultural and educational influence

IDEO has contributed significantly to the spread of creative methodologies in education and business. Its leaders, notably David Kelley, co-founded the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (the “d.school”) at Stanford University, helping embed design thinking into mainstream management and innovation curricula.
