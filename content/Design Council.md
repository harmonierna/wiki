Founded in 1944, the Design Council has for over fifty years been striving to promote the effective use of design - and design thinking - in business, in education and in government. Our purpose is 'to inspire the best use of design by the UK, in the world context, to improve prosperity and well-being.' The Design Council is independent of Government and run as an autonomous, non-profit making public body. It is funded through a grant from the Department of Trade and Industry. Most organisations are at their best when working with others and the Design Council is no exception. We work with partner organisations to ensure all our activities have the biggest impact and influence. For further information, have a look at how we work.
